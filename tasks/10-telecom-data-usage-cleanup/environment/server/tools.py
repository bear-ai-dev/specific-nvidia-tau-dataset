"""ClearWave Mobile tool handlers.

Each handler has the signature `handler(cur, args) -> dict` where `cur` is a dict
cursor inside a transaction and `args` is the already schema-validated arguments
object. The returned dict is the tool result, serialized as-is.

Handlers hold domain logic only. Every identifier, price, allowance, timestamp,
and eligibility decision that appears in a result is read or computed from the
database, never from wall time and never generated at random.

The load-bearing case is high-speed data. No handler stores or reads a
"remaining" figure: the plan carries the allowance, `usage_samples` carry
consumption, `addon_transactions` carry purchased increments, and the
`line_high_speed_balance` view sums them. That is why buying an add-on changes
what a later usage read reports, and why buying a second one changes it again.
