# This is the control on the verifier: it must score 1.0. It is not a model of
# how an agent should reason, only of what a correct reasoning process ends up
# doing to the carrier's records and telling the caller.
#
# The utterances are paraphrases of the recording, not the recorded wording. That
# is deliberate: if the oracle only passed by reciting the transcript verbatim,
# the communication check would be testing recall rather than whether the caller
# was actually told what he needed to know.
