-- The entities this conversation touches.

-- Every value here is either read back verbatim by a recorded tool result or is
-- a field the recorded results never revealed. The former are exact; the latter
-- are plausible and consistent with the call, and are marked as such.

-- Scenario clock: 2026-08-27T18:12:00-05:00. Miles Carter lost his albuterol
-- inhaler, leaves town the next morning, and the payer has already rejected the
-- refill as too soon.

-- The medication and store ids below also appear in 002_reference.sql; both are
-- pinned in gen_seed.py.
