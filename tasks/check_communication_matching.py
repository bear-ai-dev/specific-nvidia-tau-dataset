"""Check that the communication matcher is neither too tight nor too loose.

The communication half of the reward is substring matching against hand-authored
surface forms, which fails in two opposite ways and needs guarding against both.

Too tight is the common one and it is invisible: an agent says the right thing in
words nobody enumerated, scores zero, and the failure looks like the agent's
fault. Bare figures exist to fix that - listing '15' finds "15 USD", "15.00
dollars" and "a total of 15" without anyone having to predict each phrasing.

Too loose is rarer and worse, because it credits a wrong answer. A bare '15'
matched as a plain substring would be found inside '$150', '$15,000', or '15k',
and a bare 'two' inside 'network'. So bare forms are value-matched or fenced, and
this script tries deliberately wrong figures, thousands-grouped figures, and
magnitude suffixes against every numeric requirement in every task.

Runs in under a second, needs no Docker, and imports the real matcher from the
graders rather than reimplementing it, so it cannot drift from what is scored.

    ./check_communication_matching.py

Exit status is 0 only when no requirement accepts a wrong figure.
