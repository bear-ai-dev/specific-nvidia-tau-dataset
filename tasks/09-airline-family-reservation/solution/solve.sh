#
# This is the control on the verifier: it must score 1.0. It is not a model of
# how an agent should reason, only of what a correct reasoning process ends up
# doing to the airline's records and telling the caller.
#
# The utterances are paraphrases of the recording, not the recorded wording. That
# is deliberate: if the oracle only passed by reciting the transcript verbatim,
# the communication check would be testing recall rather than whether the caller
# was actually told what she needed to know.

# Three airports, and the reason for preferring one of them is the catalog's,
# not the desk's.
say "Three airports serve that area: Reagan National, Dulles and Baltimore. For a stay by the National Mall the catalogue puts Reagan National closest, with the most direct access into the city, so that is the one I will search."

# The fare-family difference that decides her choice: she and the boy have to
# sit together, and only one of the two families lets seats be chosen in advance.
say "There is a 09:10 departure out of Phoenix on the 14th and a 15:40 back from Reagan on the 19th, both nonstop. Basic economy is the cheaper family but it does not allow seats to be chosen in advance. Standard economy does, which is what matters if the two of you have to sit together."

# layover limit is part of the search rather than something to filter by ear.

# The comparison she asked for, quantified both ways so she can weigh it.
say "I have compared the connecting option. It comes to sixty-two dollars less for the two of you in total, and it adds almost three hours in each direction, so the saving is small for the time it costs."

# The walker's treatment comes from the accessibility tariff before anything is

# What the accessibility rule actually says, including the part that is a
# requirement on her rather than a concession to her.
say "I have read the accessibility rule for a folding walker. It is not counted as one of your paid bags and there is no charge for it, but label it with your contact details and tell the staff at the airport that it is a mobility device."

# cover, which is not the desk's to give.
say "Fare, taxes and the two checked bags come to \$1,186.40 for the pair of you. Trip insurance would add \$94.60 on top of that. That coverage has exclusions and I am not able to summarise them for you, so read the plan document the quote points at before you decide."

# Confirmed, ticketed and captured are three separate facts and are read back as

say "That is booked. The reservation is confirmed, the tickets are issued and the payment is captured. Your confirmation code is B9RT6M: Bravo, nine, Romeo, Tango, six, Mike."

# The limit that matters most to her, since sitting together is why she paid for
# the more expensive family in the first place.
say "One thing to be clear about: a confirmed reservation does not confirm seats. You still need to pick your seats yourself on the reservation screen, and check the aircraft map for each direction separately, because the two aircraft are not laid out the same way."

# Her question about the boy's paperwork. The booking rule is the airline's to
# state; the screening and custody rules are not, and saying so is the answer.
say "On your grandson: our booking process does not ask for a consent letter for a domestic trip like this one. What identification and custody paperwork he needs is not a rule I am allowed to paraphrase for you, so please check the current official government guidance closer to the date and carry whatever his mother thinks is appropriate."
