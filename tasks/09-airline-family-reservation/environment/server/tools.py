"""Airline tool handlers.

Each handler is `handler(cur, args) -> dict`, where `cur` is a dict cursor inside
a transaction and `args` has already been validated against the tool schema. The
returned dict is the tool result, serialized as-is.

Every value in a result is read or computed from the database rather than
generated or taken from wall time, so two runs of the same call agree, and any
figure can be traced to the rows it was summed from.

Money is the load-bearing part of this domain. No total is stored: a fare family
price is the sum over both directions of base fare plus tax, paid bags are the
bag tariff times the bag count, insurance is a per-traveler premium from the band
the fare lands in, and a mobility device charge is the accessibility tariff times
the device count. The same arithmetic runs again at booking, so a reservation
cannot be charged a total the fare rows can no longer reproduce.
