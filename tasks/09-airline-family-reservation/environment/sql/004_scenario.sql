-- The entities this conversation touches.
--
-- Every value here is either read back verbatim by a recorded tool result or is
-- a field the recorded results never revealed. The former are exact; the latter
-- are plausible and consistent with the call, and are marked as such.
--
-- The catalog side of the conversation -- the four airports, the National Mall
-- destination area, the two nonstop flights and their fare components, the
-- connecting comparison, the accessibility tariff, and the insurance bands --
-- is declared explicitly at the top of environment/gen_seed.py and lands in
-- 002_reference.sql, because those rows are catalog entries that happen to be
-- read during the call rather than entities belonging to it.
--
-- Scenario clock: 2026-08-26T12:30:00-07:00. Linda Carver is booking two
-- nonstop seats from Phoenix to Washington for herself and her grandson, with a
-- folding walker and a 200-dollar travel certificate.

-- Date of birth and email are read back by the verification result. The phone's
-- last four digits and the account creation date are never returned by any
-- recorded result; they are consistent filler so the profile is a complete

-- verification cleared on three factors.
