"""Author-time generator for this task's catalog and population SQL.

Writes two files next to itself:

  sql/002_reference.sql   airports, destination areas, schedules, fare options,
                          availability, connecting itineraries, baggage and
                          accessibility tariffs, insurance bands, the scenario
                          clock, and the identifier allocators
  sql/003_population.sql  customers, cards, certificates, prior verifications,
                          cached searches and quotes, the record-locator pool,
                          and roughly three hundred existing reservations with
                          their travelers, tenders, and certificate drawdowns

The rows the recorded conversation reads are declared explicitly near the top of
each section rather than drawn from the random population, so regenerating with a
different RNG seed cannot move them. Everything else exists to make the lookups
non-trivial: customers who share the caller's surname, an almost identical email
address, certificates that are expired or nearly spent, fare families that are
sold out on the requested date, and a stranger holding a reservation on exactly
the itinerary being booked.

Every monetary figure the recording reports is asserted here against the sum of
the components that produce it, so a mistyped fare fails at generation time
rather than at replay time. The assertions at the bottom of `build_reference`
are the arithmetic the README describes.

This script never enters the container image; see environment/.dockerignore.
