-- Scenario clock: 2026-08-27T13:05:00-04:00. Teddy Torrez returned a standing
-- desk converter to a store nine days ago. The return completed and the item is
-- back in inventory, the gift-card portion of his money came back, and the card
-- portion left the register and was never confirmed by the processor. Nothing
-- has been disputed yet: there is no case and no notification, because the
-- trace this call opens is the first record of the problem.

-- The masked email is read aloud, so it is stored exactly as the recorded
-- results render it. The masked phone is filler: no recorded result disclosed
