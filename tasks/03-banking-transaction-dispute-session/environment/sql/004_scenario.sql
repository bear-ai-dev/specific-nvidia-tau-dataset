BEGIN;

-- REVEALED: the name 'Justin Porter' together with jporter92@email.com resolves
-- uniquely to customer-justin-porter, and the profile requires the billing ZIP
-- and the birth month and day. The supplied ZIP 64114 and birthday
-- 'February 19' both match, so those are the profile's real values.
--
-- The recorded lookup reports no name back. This bank discloses the name it
-- landed on only when the caller resolved on an account identifier and needs it
-- read back to confirm the profile; a caller who supplied the name already has
-- nothing to confirm.

--
-- The one-dollar pre-authorization is the detail that makes the call turn: it is
-- the signature of a card-on-file wallet rather than a fresh card entry, which
-- is why the household-use question is worth asking before a dispute is opened.
-- It is a column on the posted charge because that is what it describes, rather
-- than a separate ledger row the statement search would then also return.
--
-- resource_label and short_ref exist because a dispute session is named after
-- this activity and reads its label aloud: the session identifier

-- from these columns rather than assembled from the transaction id by string
-- surgery.
