"""Westline retail tool handlers.

Each handler has the signature `handler(cur, args) -> dict` where `cur` is a dict
cursor inside a transaction and `args` is the already schema-validated arguments
object. The returned dict is the tool result, serialized as-is.

Handlers hold domain logic only. Every identifier, amount, deadline, carrier
detail and notification state that appears in a result is read from the
database, never computed from wall time or generated at random, so a result is
reproducible and an operator can explain any value by pointing at a row.

Three conventions are worth stating because they decide what a result looks
like:

Absent versus null. The registry types a handful of fields as string-or-null
("photo", "unit_number", "locker") and documents null as a positive answer: the
carrier recorded none. Those are emitted even when null. Every other field is
dropped when the backend does not know it, because the registry's rule is that
an absent field reads as unavailable.

Money. JSON distinguishes 40 from 40.0 and the recorded results use the integer
form for whole amounts and the decimal form otherwise, everywhere, without
exception. That is a single documented rule here rather than a per-field choice.

Human-relative time. Deadlines and scan times are stored as instants and
rendered against the scenario clock, so "18:00 tomorrow" is computed from
2026-08-26T18:00 and the frozen clock rather than stored as a sentence.
