-- The entities this conversation touches.
--
-- Every value here is either read back verbatim by a recorded tool result or is
-- a field the recorded results never revealed. The former are exact; the latter
-- are plausible, consistent with the call, and marked as such.
--
-- Scenario clock: 2026-08-26T11:20:00-04:00. This is the morning after the
-- missing-package call. Ethan Patel's coffee maker arrived with a cracked water
-- tank; separately, yesterday's delivery trace on his headphones is still open
-- and its carrier deadline falls at 18:00 this evening.
--
-- The headphones order, its scan, its trace, and the pickup preference recorded
-- on that trace are seeded here as pre-existing rows because two recorded
-- results in this conversation read them back. Per docs/DATA_QUALITY.md the two
-- retail conversations are consecutive days on one account, so this task's
-- starting state is the other task's ending state, restated as data rather than
-- as strings in a handler.

-- The masked email is read aloud, so it is stored exactly as the recorded
-- results render it. The masked phone is filler: no recorded result disclosed
-- one, and it exists so an sms notification has a destination to name.
