-- Scenario clock: 2026-08-25T15:40:00-04:00. Ethan Patel's headphones were
-- scanned as delivered to his building yesterday afternoon and are not there.
-- Nothing about the order has been disputed yet: no case, no trace, and no
-- resolution eligibility, because policy establishes eligibility only on a
-- trigger and none has fired.
