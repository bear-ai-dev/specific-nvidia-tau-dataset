BEGIN;

-- REVEALED: the address daniel.brooks17@gmail.com resolves uniquely to
-- customer-daniel-brooks, and the profile requires the billing ZIP and the
-- birth month and day. The supplied ZIP 27609 and birthday 'October 12' both
-- match, so those are the profile's real values.
--
-- The recorded lookup reports no name. This bank discloses the name it landed on
-- only when the caller resolved on an account identifier and needs the name read
-- back to confirm the profile; a caller who resolved on their own address has
-- nothing to confirm. The name is here because later work needs it, not because
-- the recording revealed it.
--
-- login_identifier_kind is 'email' as filler: this conversation never changes
-- the address, so nothing observes it.

-- masked 'a-brooks…', the application is approved, qualification is still

--
-- invited_at_display is emitted verbatim because that is the string the customer
-- hears; invited_on carries the same fact as a date so the record stays
-- queryable. See docs/SQL_ENVS.md on human-relative strings.
--
-- deadline_on is filler. The recorded knowledge answer says the deadline has not
-- passed and that the exact date lives in the tracker rather than being read
-- aloud, so no tool result depends on this value; it exists so the record is not
-- missing a fact the bank would hold.
