BEGIN;

-- REVEALED: the name 'Colin Reeves' with billing ZIP 20005 and card last four
-- 6148 resolves uniquely; the profile counts the calling channel as a factor and
-- the call did arrive on it (caller_phone_match true); and all three of
-- caller_phone, billing_zip, and card_last4 are required and matched.
--
-- caller_channel_match is TRUE because the caller confirmed he was ringing from
-- the number on the account. It is a column rather than an argument: the channel
-- the call arrived on is not something the caller can assert into a tool, and a
-- profile that counts it and whose call did not arrive on it cannot be verified
-- on that factor at all.
