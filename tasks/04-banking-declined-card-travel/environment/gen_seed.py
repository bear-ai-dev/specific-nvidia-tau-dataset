"""Author-time generator for this task's catalog and population SQL.

Writes two files next to itself:

  sql/002_reference.sql   card products, welcome offers, the knowledge base,
                          workflow and delivery profiles, the scenario clock,
                          the card-section read models, and the allocators
  sql/003_population.sql  customers, cards, ledger activity, restrictions,
                          referrals, sessions, notifications, and verification
                          records for a realistic estate

The rows the recorded conversation touches are not drawn from the random
population; they are declared in sql/004_scenario.sql, so regenerating with a
different RNG seed cannot move them. Everything here exists to make the lookups
non-trivial: customers who share a surname and a full name with the target,
trusted channels that are not enrolled, identity factors that do not match,
withdrawn products and expired offers that must be filtered out, restrictions
that confirming activity cannot lift, and sessions nobody ever opened.

This script never enters the container image; see environment/.dockerignore.

# the agent needs before reading anything back. The second read, once the caller
# has been verified through and the agent is working the review, adds where the

# was already stated. That is a disclosure depth rather than a change of data:
# the same two rows are read both times.
#
# So `declines` carries two views and every other section carries one. Reading a
# section a second time serves the next deeper view and then repeats the deepest,
# and the count of reads served is a row in card_section_read_cursor so an

    # fields beside the housing-payment field, a fee-exemption record whose

    # priority. Retrieval orders by priority, then pattern length, then
    # identifier, so a recorded question still resolves to the recorded record.
